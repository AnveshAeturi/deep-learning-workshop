##  Scene Graph Parsing by Attention Graph

Workshop paper accepted into the NeurIPS 2018 ViGIL Workshop.


### Abstract

>  Scene graph representations, which form a graph of visual object nodes together with their attributes and relations, have proved useful across a variety of vision and language applications. Recent work in the area has used Natural Language Processing dependency tree methods to automatically build scene graphs.

>  In this work, we present an 'Attention Graph' mechanism that can be trained end-to-end, and produces a scene graph structure that can be lifted directly from the top layer of a standard Transformer model.

>  The scene graphs generated by our model achieve an F-score similarity of 52.21% to ground-truth graphs on the evaluation set using the SPICE metric, surpassing the best previous approaches by 2.5%.

### Running

The code in this repo is precisely the code used to get the results reported in the 
Workshop paper.  However, there is a fair amount of data preprocessing to perform,
which is a little fiddly.

```
cd ../2018-10_SceneGraphParsing
#  Download an updated 'bist-parser' to handle the Visual Genome data preprocessing
git clone https://github.com/mdda/bist-parser.git
```

Explicit details for reproducing the results will appear here.

In the mean-time, please see the ```notes.txt``` file for hints...
